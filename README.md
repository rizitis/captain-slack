#### LATEST NEWS
*If you build using [AthOS](https://github.com/rizitis/PLASMA_WORLD) (athos) build system, **cptn info** cmd will print dependencies informations also*:
![AthOS](./athos.png)

*update*:<br>
~~After [conraid](https://github.com/conraid/SlackBuilds/issues/37) suggestions I made some changes. Now `cptn info` command will read also his build as we both storing a slack-required file in `/usr/doc/$PRGNAM-$VERSION/` folder and things are more easy and more proper discribed ;)<br>
If you also have local builds is a good choice to include a slack-required file in the same folder.~~<br>
- *slack-required* format is:
```
foo
foo1
foo-do
etc...
```

For your SlackBuilds from SBo-ponce you must add this line in SlackBuild:
`grep "^REQUIRES=" $CWD/$PRGNAM.info | sed 's/^REQUIRES="//;s/"$//' | tr ' ' '\n' >  "$PKG"/usr/doc/"$PRGNAM-$VERSION"/slack-required`

> If you are in Slackware-current and using slpkg you can use my [fork](https://github.com/rizitis/slackbuilds-current) of [ponce repo](https://github.com/Ponce/slackbuilds).
> This fork has all SlackBuild patched for slack-required and more... But you use it at your **own risk**.

This is the edit in all SlackBuilds:
```
cd $PKG
if [ -f $CWD/slack-required ]; then cat $CWD/slack-required > $PKG/install/slack-required; fi
if [ -f $CWD/slack-required ]; then cat $CWD/slack-required > $PKG/usr/doc/$PRGNAM-$VERSION/slack-required; fi
if [ -f $CWD/dependees-on ]; then cat $CWD/dependees-on > $PKG/usr/doc/$PRGNAM-$VERSION/dependees-on; fi
/sbin/makepkg -l y -c n $OUTPUT/$PRGNAM-$VERSION-$ARCH-$BUILD$TAG.$PKGTYPE
if [ -f $CWD/slack-required ]; then cp $CWD/slack-required  $OUTPUT/$PRGNAM-$VERSION-$ARCH-$BUILD$TAG.dep; fi
```
> READ [disclaimer](https://github.com/rizitis/slackbuilds-current#disclaimer) first!
> Original SlackBuilds Maintainers or SlackBuilds.org or Ponce **has no responsibility** about this fork!
